This license does not include: (a) access to the Service by Posting Agents; or (b) any collection, aggregation, copying, duplication, display or derivative use of the Service nor any use of data mining, robots, spiders, or similar data gathering and extraction tools for any purpose unless expressly permitted by Reborns. A limited exception to (b) is provided to general purpose internet search engines and non-commercial public archives that use such tools to gather information for the sole purpose of displaying hyperlinks to the Service, provided they each do so from a stable IP address or range of IP addresses using an easily identifiable agent and comply with our robots.txt file. "General purpose internet search engine" does not include a website or search engine or other service that specializes in classified listings or in any subset of classifieds listings such as jobs, housing, for sale, services, or personals, or which is in the business of providing classified ad listing services.<br><br>Reborns permits you to display on your website, or create a hyperlink on your website to, individual postings on the Service so long as such use is for noncommercial and/or news reporting purposes only (e.g., for use in personal web blogs or personal online media). If the total number of such postings displayed or linked to on your website exceeds one hundred (100) postings, your use will be presumed to be in violation of the TOU, absent express permission granted by Reborns to do so. You may also create a hyperlink to the home page of Reborns sites so long as the link does not portray Reborns, its employees, or its affiliates in a false, misleading, derogatory, or otherwise offensive matter.<br><br>Reborns offers various parts of the Service in RSS format so that users can embed individual feeds into a personal website or blog, or view postings through third party software news aggregators. Reborns permits you to display, excerpt from, and link to the RSS feeds on your personal website or personal web blog, provided that (a) your use of the RSS feed is for personal, non-commercial purposes only, (b) each title is correctly linked back to the original post on the Service and redirects the user to the post when the user clicks on it, (c) you provide, adjacent to the RSS feed, proper attribution to 'Reborns' as the source, (d) your use or display does not suggest that Reborns promotes or endorses any third party causes, ideas, web sites, products or services, (e) you do not redistribute the RSS feed, and (f) your use does not overburden Reborns's systems. Reborns reserves all rights in the content of the RSS feeds and may terminate any RSS feed at any time.<br><br>Use of the Service beyond the scope of authorized access granted to you by Reborns immediately terminates said permission or license. In order to collect, aggregate, copy, duplicate, display or make derivative use of the Service or any Content made available via the Service for other purposes (including commercial purposes) not stated herein, you must first obtain a license from Reborns.</p>

If any provision of the TOU is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties' intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of the TOU remain in full force and effect. You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of the Service or the TOU must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred.<br><br>Reborns makes no representation that materials on this site are appropriate or available for use in other locations.

                          <h5>19. VIOLATION OF TERMS AND LIQUIDATED DAMAGES</h5>
                          <br>
                        <p>Please report any violations of the TOU, by flagging the posting(s) for review by contacting us at:<br><br>https://www.reborns.com/contact_us.cgi<br><br>Our failure to act with respect to a breach by you or others does not waive our right to act with respect to subsequent or similar breaches.<br><br>You understand and agree that, because damages are often difficult to quantify, if it becomes necessary for Reborns to pursue legal action to enforce these Terms, you will be liable to pay Reborns the following amounts as liquidated damages, which you accept as reasonable estimates of Rebornss' damages for the specified breaches of these Terms:<br><br>a. If you post a message that (1) impersonates any person or entity; (2) falsely states or otherwise misrepresents your affiliation with a person or entity; or (3) that includes personal or identifying information about another person without that person's explicit consent, you agree to pay Reborns one thousand dollars ($1,000) for each such message. This provision does not apply to Content that constitutes lawful non-deceptive parody of public figures.<br><br>b. If Reborns establishes limits on the frequency with which you may access the Service, or terminates your access to or use of the Service, you agree to pay Reborns one hundred dollars ($100) for each message posted in excess of such limits or for each day on which you access Reborns in excess of such limits, whichever is higher.<br><br>c. If you send unsolicited email advertisements to Reborns email addresses or Reborns users or through Reborns computer systems, you agree to pay Reborns twenty five dollars ($25) for each such email.<br><br>d. If you post Content in violation of the TOU, other than as described above, you agree to pay Reborns one hundred dollars ($100) for each Item of Content posted. In its sole discretion, Reborns may elect to issue a warning before assessing damages.<br><br>e. If you are a Posting Agent that uses the Service in violation of the TOU, in addition to any liquidated damages under clause (d), you agree to pay Reborns one hundred dollars ($100) for each and every Item you post in violation of the TOU. A Posting Agent will also be deemed an agent of the party engaging the Posting Agent to access the Service (the "Principal"), and the Principal (by engaging the Posting Agent in violation of the TOU) agrees to pay Reborns an additional one hundred dollars ($100) for each Item posted by the Posting Agent on behalf of the Principal in violation of the TOU.<br><br>f. If you aggregate, display, copy, duplicate, reproduce, or otherwise exploit for any purpose any Content (except for your own Content) in violation of these Terms without Reborns's express written permission, you agree to pay Reborns three thousand dollars ($3,000) for each day on which you engage in such conduct.<br><br>Otherwise, you agree to pay Reborns's actual damages, to the extent such actual damages can be reasonably calculated. Notwithstanding any other provision of these Terms, Reborns retains the right to seek the remedy of specific performance of any term contained in these Terms, or a preliminary or permanent injunction against the breach of any such term or in aid of the exercise of any power granted in these Terms, or any combination thereof.</p>

                        <p>Your receipt of an electronic or other form of order confirmation does not constitute Reborns acceptance of your order or the acceptance of your order from one of Reborns's sellers, nor does it signify confirmation of Reborns or its sellers offer to sell.
